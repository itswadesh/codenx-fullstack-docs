## About CRUD Automation

CodeNx CRUD is a Javascript CRUD boiler plate, perfect for rapid development. It is built over the cutting edge technology and purely modular code.

This is based on ReST API and disconnected architecture. Hence you are free to use any front-end or backend. 

This has the potential to be converted to any type of web application with a little customizations

- Integrated authentication module `Login, Signup, Change Password, Forgot Password, Reset Password, Edit Profile`
- User Roles module with level of separation
- Best user experience with Single Page Application
- Modular coding structure
- Auto deploy to production server
- Better and cleaner JavaScript code
- Simplified installation and configuration
- Reliable: Load fast and provide offline experience
- Fast: Respond quickly to user actions
- Engaging: Feel like a native app on mobile devices
- Industry best practices
- Accessibility support out of the box
- All configurations at 1 place

Uses all javascript technology(**Full Stack**). Hence require cloud infrastructure for hosting. You may choose any cloud provider like Digital Ocean, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Linode, etc. It uses the following Frameworks and Database
- VueJS (Client Side Scripting)

Being an **asynchronous event driven architecture** its speed goes upto 5 fold as compared to existing php based solutions.
